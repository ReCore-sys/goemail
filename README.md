The actual name is to be decided on but for now it is Gomail. Mommiemilkies.org is looking hopeful.

An email website that is written in go. It is mostly a joke but is functional if you wish to use it.

### TODO:

- Implement redis to store active users.
- Actually be able to send emails.
- UI-ify the inbox page
- Require the inbox page to be logged in. (Use cookies and have the cookie as a key for the redis thing)
- News feed
- 404 page
- 500 page
- Page where you can add spam images and text.
